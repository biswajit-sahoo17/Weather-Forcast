Project Description:-

-The Weather Forecast Web Application is a modern, responsive, and user-friendly web-based system developed to provide accurate and up-to-date weather information for various cities. The project enables users to search for any supported city and instantly view weather details such as temperature, weather condition, humidity, wind speed, pressure, visibility, cloud percentage, sunrise, and sunset time.

-This application is designed using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, following a modular and well-structured approach. The system includes multiple pages such as Home, Features, About, and Developers, ensuring proper navigation and professional presentation.

-Instead of relying on continuous external API calls, the project uses a predefined weather database (JavaScript object) for multiple Indian cities, including Odisha cities, making it suitable for academic demonstration and offline use.

-The application also supports dark and light theme switching, responsive design for mobile and desktop devices, animated UI elements, and dynamic weather icons for better user experience.

Problem Statement:-
1.Weather information is essential for daily planning and decision-making.

2.Many users need a simple, fast, and easy-to-use weather system.

3.Existing systems may be complex, API-dependent, or difficult for beginners to understand.

4.There is a need for a lightweight academic project that demonstrates real-time UI updates using JavaScript.

Objectives of the Project:-

1.To design a web-based weather forecasting system

2.To display current weather details for different cities

3.To implement city-based weather search functionality

4.To demonstrate dynamic data handling using JavaScript

5.To develop a responsive and interactive user interface

6.To provide theme switching (dark/light mode) for better usability

7.To build a project suitable for academic and learning purposes

System Overview:-

The system works as follows:-
The user enters a city name in the search box.

JavaScript checks the city name against the predefined weather database.

If the city is found, weather details are displayed dynamically.

If the city is not found, an error message is shown.

Weather information updates without reloading the page.

The theme preference is saved using localStorage.
